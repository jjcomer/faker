# faker

Just a quick little app which lets you fake a web response really
fast.
Right now it only supports the customization the response code and the
response itself.

## Usage

Either run using:
'''
lein run config_filename
'''

or compile as an uberjar and run like so:
'''
java -jar the_uberjar config_filename
'''

The following is a sample config file which defines two routes
'''
[{:verb :get
  :path "/"
  :res "HELLO WORLD"
  :code 401}
 {:verb :get
  :path "/another"
  :res "ANOTHER ONE"
  :code 200}]
'''
